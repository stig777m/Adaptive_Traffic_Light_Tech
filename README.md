# Adaptive_Traffic_Light_Tech

A basic project in C which aims to find the perfect solution of a always changing traffic conitions at a signal.

A crossroad which has roads coming from many direction, the traffic on each road might be different for each condition, currently a majority of traffic lights have preset time for the green light, and this preset time is equal for evevry road, this designs holds up traffic on the busy road, to signal green in roads with less traffic where such long green light time is not needed, in conclusion this designs sees each road equal.

In this project we employ a way to find the traffic build up at every road continously and feed it into our project.
Once we have the percentage of traffic at every road, then the program finds gives the road with the most traffic a longer green light time, compared to a road with much less traffic, also gives the pedestrain crossing signal after the busiest road is beign cleared to maximum pedestrain traffic movement.
